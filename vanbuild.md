# Start
I bought a bare cargo van in July '19 and over the next 6 months I built it into a home. During this time I was also working full time, moved out of the house I was renting, and donated most of my possessions. It was a lot.

# Alpha
In December '19 I moved into the van full time and left snowy Michigan for warmer weather and the open road.

# Beta
Slowly but surely, I made many improvements while living partially at my Mom's and in my van. In June '20 the van was finally "photo-worthy" and I was incredibly comfortable living in it full time, which I did from here on out.

# Finished
Never ðŸ˜…. I'm still living in my van and making small improvements like adding a vermicompost, plants, storage optimizations, etc.
