Extruded aluminum  
Inspiration for design is that I wanted to be able to fold mattress into couch in 4 different directions. It turned out to not be worth the hassle though. Regular ole' 2x4s are much simpler so I switched to that eventually.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <img src="/public/vanbuild/5.0.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <img src="/public/vanbuild/5.1.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <img src="/public/vanbuild/5.2.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>
