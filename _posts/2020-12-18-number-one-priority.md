excerpt: "Your number one priority should be your own happiness. Your second priority is your purpose in life."

One of the most important things you can do for your mental health and overall hapiness is think regularly about your priorities. Your number one priority should be your own happiness. If you're not happy, you should stop what you're doing immediately and do something that does make you happy. For me, I'm happiest when I'm living in the moment- fully present and in kind of a [flow state](https://daringtolivefully.com/how-to-enter-the-flow-state).

Listen to music. dance, sing, feel it.
Take off your shoes and feel the ground. Close your eyes and feel gravity pushing you into the earth.
Go outside and

Experience the beauty of our world.

There's no rush. Don't force anything. If you commit your entire life to simply being happy, I promise you will achieve more than in your wildest dreams. This is because you attract the best things in life when you're following your passions and what makes you happy.

Every time you do it it gets easier. Every time you recognize when you're not totally happy and switch your focus back to something true to your priorities, you grow. It's the most important area in life to grow and it feels amazing. It's making progress towards your number one goal. I personally don't believe it's possible for us humans to achieve the goal and even if we did, would it be a catch-22? Because doesn't part of the amazing-ness of being happy and in the moment come from the pride and joy you feel for yourself for not being unhappy as you once were in the past? But that's a whole other conversation...

Imagine being a talented singer. You love to sing and you're good at it. It comes naturally and when you're doing it, you are living in the moment and happy. But you rarely sing anymore because you have a job. You put the priority of having money over the priority of doing what you love most in life. If you're ever unhappy 

There are buddhist monks who have proven we can achieve true happiness. Repeatedly, anyone can do it if they commit enough time. No matter the surroundings, they have can be happy. We owe it to them to be happy. Many would consider their society and living conditions harsh, disconnected, and crazy so we owe it to them to make the most of all the luxuries we have. I'm not talking about buying more things, I'm talking about our ability to do research, travel, and invest in important things that align with our top priorities.



I believe that people are generally good. If you were to assume some people are bad-intentioned to their core then this will not work for them. I do not believe this is the case though. The capacity is within us all if we can learn.
I believe everyone has a moral compass and knows the right thing to do. Yes, people have been tricked into believing lies, causing them to act out of accordance with their true priorities and motivations.
Like Hitler probably valued some fucked up shit over things that were real and true; filled with love. When someone you love and respect teaches you something, it shapes your compass and transforms your world view. We must evaluate our moral compasses. If we have any shadow of a doubt about one then it's worth really investigating.

Do I think I've reached the same level as a monk? Fuck no! Lol. I think most people, myself included only experience short periods of what is regular life for them. We've all felt the peace that comes over us when we're truly happy, enjoying, living, experiencing the marvels of this life. So. We owe it to the people who can achieve such clarity and peace to be able to do the same with all the means and privilege I and I think most people I know have, We are educated, wealthy, privileged people. We were given some of the best cards in the game of life by being blessed with everything each one of us has. Some more than others but isn't it obvious by now that my point is: where you were born, what conditions you were brought up in, or maybe even currently live in; matter.
