I find comfort in knowing that I will die one day. It springs me into action because we only have a finite time here in this world. Over the last 18 months of so, I've thought long and hard about what I want to spend my precious time doing. And through that, I realized there are many things I currently do that I don't actually want to be doing. I'll try to explain the things I believe are worth my time, and by simple arithmetic, the things that will no longer fit into my life.

### Believing in something greater than myself

Before I jump into my desire to brew my own beer, bake my own bread, grow my own food, and use my own furniture, I want to explain the *why*.

My main goal in life currently is to live in balance with nature. That means trying to give it as much as it gives me. To be alive is to be in a relationship with nature and I believe the hallmarks of a balanced, healthy relationship are listening to, learning from, and treating with respect the other party. I also think living in this way is what it means to be human. To sum it up in a word, grateful. Like Skywoman dancing on the turtle’s back.

I feel a calling to love all life and help it thrive. I believe it is my purpose in life to be a good steward of nature and play the role nature intended for us. Clearly nature did not intend for all of the oil and gas inside the Earth to be lit on fire and exploded. It does not want to be covered in cement for millions of square miles. It did not intend for there to be any idea of waste or garbage. If there's anything I can do to help nature be happier, I want to do it. I want to ride my bike to the farmer's market instead of driving my car to Wal-Mart. I want to pick up litter I see on the ground when I'm out and about. I want to feel the gratitude I have for Mother Nature increase with each of these actions, as I help both the Earth and my soul.

Life is all connected. I believe there is a spiritual connection between all life forms. And if you can’t get behind the spiritual concept of that, look at the purely scientific. For example, all living things would die without microorganisms. Owls would die without mice. Plants would die out without wind. There is a relationship between everything. Affecting one affects the other(s). I feel that many humans do not understand the relationships they have with the world around them. Humans have somehow distanced themselves from their relationships with their fellow lifeforms and have grown to believe we are separate from nature and have the right to do whatever we want with it ([mining](https://www.savebristolbay.org/), [drilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enbridge_Pipeline_System#Accidents_and_incidents), [polluting](https://environmentalintegrity.org/news/13-oil-refineries-in-u-s-released-cancer-causing-benzene-above-epa-action-levels-in-2020/)). This is not only wrong but also impossible. We are part of nature! We are children living inside Mother Nature.

Humans are meant to dance, sing, and show love to all living things. I think it’s incredibly sad that many people do not realize the world they’re missing out on by their disconnection from nature. Not to mention the negative impacts it has on all of us living things because of the imbalance caused by humans dropping the ball.

I urge people to ask themselves if they reciprocate the love that nature gives to them. Doing so benefits all of nature, especially the being(s) reciprocating. When you live in balance with nature, things in your life magically align and life becomes more beautiful than you ever could've dreamed.

Ideally, there’s a balance to all of our actions. Sadly, I don’t think the balance is healthy for a majority of humans in the world today (myself included). Which is a shame because it’s in our best interest! There’s a lot of lies society tells us about what we should want, how we should behave, and what’s acceptable, normal behavior. These lies should be treated as such and cause us to seriously rethink all of our actions.

### We’re all doing our best with what we’re given

I’m only able to live like this and make the decisions I do, with the priorities I have because I do not fear for my life. I have money to buy food and shelter, family and friends who love me, and a healthy, capable body and mind. By many objective standards, I am more blessed than most in this world. Everyone’s situation is different so no judgement to anyone on the path they’re on in life because I will never know the depths of another’s struggles. I have nothing but love for everyone. I know we're all being our best person. Doing our best. I hope that people don’t feel any judgement from me. Tupac said it nicely: “I ain't mad at cha, got nothin but love for ya, do your thing boy”.

No two living things are alike and therefore the callings of two different beings are never the same. So my goal isn’t to tell people what to do, but to try to share things I feel called to do and the reasons why. We've forgotten our role in the world but nature will never forget our role so it's easy to find our way again.

### Following the call

I want everything I do be a true desire, not just a means to an end that I'm not 100% sure about. I don't know if I need a job (aka the safety of money and health care) so when I'm doing it I'm not functioning at 100%. I lose focus quickly and it's hard to motivate myself to start up again. I end up wasting a lot of time in no-mans-land being slightly distraught at not having a clear desire of what I should do next. It's doubly bad because then, I feel bad about wasting time.

I feel a moral obligation to do different work than I'm doing currently in my mon-fri job. Nothing is bad with the act of writing code and I do still enjoy programming but I believe what is done with the software I build can be improved. The company I'm working for currently is super cool and 2 years ago I would've said it is my dream job (a network of solar powered computers monitoring air quality and weather data). I'm happy working for them but I think I can do better in terms of helping people live in balance with nature. I think I still have much room to improve in this area and I want to master something before I advocate for it. I know I know incredibly little about nature. The names of plants, birds, and insects are not known to me. I want to learn how to play a musical instrument and eat a diet of 100% locally grown, organic food. I'm not doing these things now to what I believe is the best of my ability and I believe quitting my job will not hurt my chances of furthering these desires. There's so many things I think are more important for humans to do right now than writing software for internet applications. My work has already hired my replacement, in less than a month. It's not hard to find people when you're offering a $120k/yr salary. But I think we need less people working for money and more people working for love. Love of nature, gratitude for everything Mother Nature has blessed us with. I think a lot of people should quit their jobs so how can I encourage someone to do that if I haven't done it myself?

### Trust

I don't know what my future will look like but I trust that making the decision to quit my job will make my future path clearer and allow me to learn things and have new experiences that bring opportunities I may never have imagined. We process so many thoughts, many subconscious, and when we regularly do things that we're not 100% happy and stoked about, it steals time from us to focus on what we truly believe in.

```
When you want more than you have
You think you need
And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed
```

In my experience, if you feel strongly about doing something and you believe it's the right thing (scew if it's the smart choice), then it's probably the right move and will help you grow. Once you make it, unforseen opportunities will eventually become visible to you. Experiencing new things and learning from them is one of the greatest joys and miracles of life. I do not aim at "success", I aim at being a happy human. Full of gratitude.

When I listen to Bob Marley's lyrics, "open your eye's, look within. Are you happy with the life you're livin?", I do not feel happy with everything in my life. It's impossible for me to identify all the things in my life I'm not happy about and know the solution to removing that thing I'm less than stoked about, but any nudge in the right direction helps. Nietzhe said "given a why, a man can endure any how". If I feel like I have a why strong enough to power a how that is an uncomfortable, anti-capitalist, pro-nature thing; I'm going to act on it.

I’m proud of myself for choosing to quit my job. More proud that I would've been than if I were to continue working full time at a tech company. When struggling with big questions, ask yourself- “what will my future self be more proud of me doing?”. Not “will I regret this?”. Come from a place of love and trust, not status-quo and fear.

I take my role in the world seriously because I’ve seen the effect one small act can have, but I also do not take it seriously because the universe is infinite and my existence is humorous to even ponder in comparison. So I do my best without caring about making mistakes. Because it doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.

Now, let me leave you with a list of things I already do but will have more time to do after Friday, July 30th, 2021; my last day of work at Very:
- read
- yoga
- write
- guitar
- sing
- dance
- run
- farm
- paint
- cook
- meditate
- volunteer

To some, this list may seem short and simple. But for me, I feel a deep passion and yearning for each item. I could spend all day getting lost in any of them. And that is exactly what I plan to do.
