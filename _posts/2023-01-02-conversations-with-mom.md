I write this in an attempt to shed light on the patterns present in my relationship with my Mom so we may recognize these tendencies in all of ourselves and heal...

Communicating with my Mom often feels like speaking a foreign language. There is little shared perspective and therefore frequent misunderstandings. Very rarely do I feel we understand each other. Seemingly every conversation is hard- ripe with triggers, perceived judgment, and fear for the well-being of the other party. I am scared my Mom is living her life based entirely on what others think of her, and my Mom is worried I'm not living up to my full potential.

Here's how this setup plays out in some conversations we've had:

##### August 16
I called my Mom and told her I would be spending 4-7 days hiking the PCT. I said, "I'm going to go backpacking in the forest, just Quinn and I for like a week! I've never done it and I feel a strong calling to go". I expressed my overwhelming excitement and stoke for spending multiple days alone with just me and Quinn out in beautiful nature. My dog and I in the place that makes us both happiest. I spoke of my excitement of sitting, watching, listening, and observing. I'd been very busy and had a full summer and wanted to get this adventure in to relieve myself from the constant flurry of activities I'd been doing. I longed to sit and meditate, maybe read some books, maybe do some writing. I was stoked about this idea. I even offered that if she wanted, she could borrow my van for the time I was away as I knew she was in between rental houses and wanted to visit Oregon.

Then my mom spoke. She spoke of fears, of disconnection, of anger and frustration. I was speechless.

She said:
"I feel like I'm losing you..."
"You seem to be getting more and more extreme..."
"It's been three years of you living in your van, I expected you to settle down, have a house and a girlfriend by now..."
"I feel like I'm losing you..."
"You are being selfish by living this lifestyle..."

At a loss for words, feeling the disconnection she spoke of now, I was reeling.

For the first time ever, my Mom expressed that she felt my choices were selfish. She wanted desperately for me to stop living the way I was, to end this phase of living in a van and return to a normal life. An unselfish life where I was safe in the suburbs, instead of out alone in the wild.

She spoke at me for quite some time, releasing a lot of pent up feelings she'd been harboring. Me going backpacking was apparently the straw that broke the camel's back. I pleaded with her that she was not losing me. That I was not partaking in risky behavior, sure of imminent death. "I'm more likely to get in an accident while driving a car than while backpacking!". I was feeling the effects of the accusations she'd made, though and seriously questioning everything I was doing with my life.

Am I being selfish? Why do I want to be alone in the woods? Am I partaking in risky behavior, sure to soon have a serious accident?

...

After we spoke, I felt immense guilt and shame. Everything that I was so excited about doing was now making me feel sick to my stomach. I figured that if my Mom felt that strongly that I was wasting my life, living selfishly and without regard for her wellbeing then surely there was some truth to what she was saying. I felt guilty now for wanting to spend time alone in nature. I second-guessed all of the plans I was so excited about making and struggled to find joy in my time spent in nature because now it was a reminder of my Mom's belief that I'm selfishly wasting my life.

This conversation was the source of a huge struggle for me. It was an eye opener of what my Mom thinks of me and therefore made me question everything about myself and the way I am choosing to show up in the world.

It appears as though my Mom and I love each other so much we fear for the other's well-being. Love is the root of it but that fear is there and it causes very interesting things to happen. Such as momentary loss of all feelings of love for one another.

_11:16am Sheri: Faith goes against a culture of comfort. Fr Sean 8/28/22 mass homily.
Church today made me think of you. And made me think my mother's instinct that just wants you to be safe is slightly out of whack. I hope we can continue the conversation when I get to OR in a few days. Love you ðŸ’š_

I had two thoughts after receiving that text:
1. All praise to the glory of God!!!
2. Now if only I could get her to see what I see when I think of a _culture of comfort_ ðŸ¤”...

This desire I have to get my Mom to see the world the way I see it never works out well. In this next conversation, I texted my Mom a link to a video I'd just watched because it struck me as an interesting insight into the problem of polarization in our society and I wanted to hear her thoughts on it. I did not come out and say the polarization piece though because I thought it would be more powerful if she watched it and came to that conclusion herself. She had recently shared with me a [podcast episode with Brene Brown interviewing a Franciscan Priest, Fr. Richard Rohr](https://open.spotify.com/episode/60j9urMuyE7CB6pSw76mOs?si=OwIOGnNzStm58y0FJerfgQ), where polarization and certitude were main points of discussion so I thought she would be receptive to my attempt to share real-life examples of these phenomena.

_11:30am Cash: Channel 5 is a good YouTube channel if you ever feel like you want to get some exposure to the perspectives of other communities outside the ones youâ€™ve lived in. I recently watched this one covering a pro choice rally and was curious what your take aways from it would be: [youtube.com/watch?v=HVzG1Va1wI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVzG1Va1wI4)_

_12:01pm Sheri: I'm staunch pro life. It's a moral issue not a political issue. I will not debate this topic and don't want to watch this video. Especially not today. I just dropped Frittata off for his flight. Feeling very sad. And now I'm feeling angry and pissed off too_

Then, I gave my Mom a phone call to try to recover this straying attempt at connection and dialogue. I wanted to explain my intention behind sending the video so she could see how she totally misunderstood it and then hopefully she could entertain the thought exercise I wanted to participate in with her. Needless to say, it did not go as planned. I believe I ended up hanging up on her after interrupting her long-winded rant by sarcastically saying, "I LOVE YOUUU". But what I really meant in that moment was, "I hate you". And I cannot listen to you any more. I was furious.

_4:50pm Sheri: I love you. I always will. But it's really hard to be around someone when you feel like they're always trying to change you. I'm serious Cash you need to lighten up on me and other people who believe different than you._

Looking back on this now, I see it as an incredibly beautiful and humbling lesson. I tried to share polarization with my Mom and ended up polarizing us. Go figure! I am sure this will not be the last time. But I hope we are able to see these lessons, be honest and present with the parts of ourselves that have lived them, accept, and move forward with the integration of their wisdom.

What tender, silly, beautiful things we humans are.

> Generational trauma is real and by doing the work required to heal family relationships, we can limit its effects and live with more peace and love instead of spreading fear and judgement in the world. Please reach out to the people in your life that you'd rather not, do the work that you'd rather not, and let the thorns be your guide. We must all do our personal work that is required to show up in the world the best we can be.
