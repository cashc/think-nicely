Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. I hope that by reading my writing you feel a closer connection to me and are filled with more love and passion.

I'm 27, from Michigan, and I live and travel in my self-converted camper van with my dog Quinn. My goal is to create more harmony between humans and nature. I hope to do this through learning as much as I can, and then sharing my knowledge with others and helping implement thoughtfully designed ecosystems.
