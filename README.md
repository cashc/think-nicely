Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. I hope it brings you feelings of love, gratitude, and connection.

About me: My goal is to create harmony between humans and nature. I have survived 28 winters, have a degree in Computer Science, and live in my self-converted camper van with my dog, Quinn. I camp primarily on small farms where I volunteer and in return get to live sustainably, in community, surrounded by amazing people, plants, and animals who teach me the most important lessons of life.
