About me: I have survived 28 winters, have a degree in Computer Science, and live in my self-converted camper van with my dog. I camp primarily on small farms where I volunteer and in return get to live sustainably, in community, surrounded by amazing people, plants, and animals. My goal is to create more harmony between humans and nature.
