Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. I hope that by reading my writing you feel a closer connection to me and are filled with more love and passion.

About me: I have survived 27 winters, have a degree in Computer Science, and live in my self-converted camper van with my dog. I camp primarily on small farms where I volunteer and in return get to live sustainably, in community, surrounded by amazing people, plants, and animals. My goal is to create more harmony between humans and nature. I hope to do this through implementing regenerative ecosystems using Permaculture design principles.
