Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. I hope that by reading my writing you feel a closer connection to me and are filled with more love and passion.

I live and travel in my self-converted camper van with my dog Quinn. I park primarily on small farms where I volunteer and in return get to live sustainably, in community, surrounded by amazing people, plants, and animals. My goal is to create more harmony between humans and nature. I hope to do this through learning as much as I can, and then sharing my knowledge with others and helping implement thoughtfully designed ecosystems.
