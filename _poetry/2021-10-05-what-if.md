# What If  

What if you smile as you walk by  
It makes them feel loved  
You gave them the gift of returning to the present  
To invoke the feeling of love is the highest goal  

What if the wind is Mother Nature’s way of giving you a hug  
The sight of a wild thing brings you to tears  
You felt loved, always  
You are more than you’ll ever know  
You know nothing  

What if everything is a gift  
You are given infinitely, with nothing asked in return  
When you show gratitude, you receive back tenfold  

What if you were to do what you’re most afraid of  
Insecurity, guilt, and shame are your greatest teachers  
Everything you’ve ever done was leading to this  
You are enough  
_You_ are exactly the same as me
