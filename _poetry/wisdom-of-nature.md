# Wisdom of nature

The asphalt is hard under my bare feet  
I glide over it, jogging like a ballerina  
Oof, there’s a pebble!  
I grin because I know my trail is near

Up the hill I go  
Slipping in the moist soil  
Hands and feet are dirty  
The trees welcome me back

I’m a guest in this home  
My hosts are welcoming  
Gratitude comes naturally  
For I’m in the presence of greatness

I’ve heard the trees are wise  
I do not doubt it  
I’m comforted by their presence  
I caress that pebble on my way back home
