# Energized

Fatigued from seeing problems without solutions  
Maybe the problems are wrong  
War in Ukraine, sea level rising, not even humans are thriving  
Perhaps the problems are the solutions  
Nature’s never gotten it wrong before  
What a relief to relax and enjoy  
The end of the world  
Maybe I don’t need that Tesla after all  
Accepting reality and letting it go  
Change is the only constant I know  
Doing nothing is the revolution I need  
Meditation germinating a seed  
Tuning me in to the frequency of my soul  
I realize this need I have to grow  
There are no problems, only motivations to act  
With so much pain and suffering in the world  
I make a pact  
I will not add to it  
I will not numb out, ignore, or stress any more  
I choose joy  
The joy that lies humming underneath it all
