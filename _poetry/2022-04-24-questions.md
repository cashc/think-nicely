# Questions worth asking

What is life?  
It has an undefinable power to it  
Somehow, it just grows  
Like a seed pushing through Earth  

What is a mind?  
It creates infinitely  
Is constantly changing and never stagnant  
Like a river flowing over sand  

What is love?  
The mysterious force that brings about life  
The only thing that persists  
Eternal  
It is everything  

What is gratitude?  
Reciprocating love  
The most powerful tool a mind wields  

What is time?  
That which causes all to be lost  
Nothing lasts  

What is hope?  
To desire  

Is hope dangerous?  
It can be  
Hope can incite fear of losing that which we can never have  
Believing we can _have_ anything is dangerous  

How do you live without hope?  
Trust fully in love  
It takes courage  
Love with full acceptance that you will never hold onto it  
Make peace with the hopelessness of our situation  

What is the meaning of life?  
To experience beauty  
To love
