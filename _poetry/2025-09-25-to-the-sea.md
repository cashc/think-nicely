## on our way to the sea

we are a river flowing to the sea.
each drop of water a decision by you and me.  
the current flows along, singing a certain song  
sometimes we flow fast  
droplets flying by.  
some areas are weak and others strong.  
which way do you want to flow?  
what do you want to see?  
with whom do you want to be on your way to the sea?

our minds add a drop here and a drop there.  
as the river flows, which current pulls at me?  
white water is loud and im aware of its strength.  
cautious i must be, on my way to the sea.

with every drop added, our current grows.  
each of us a stream, flowing to the sea.  
a decision made in anger has a certain frequency.  
it rushes fast, churning aggressively.  
decisions made from love are slower, taking time to notice others.

everything in existence has its place in this world.  
granite, solid. cedar, splitting.  
raven, charred and singing.  
their notes are clear.  
listening deeply, the sounds of each appear.  
you are a human composer and therefore must decide  
what notes will you hit?  
which melodies do we create?

in this symphony of streams, there is music being played  
each of us is an instrument.
we play by deciding where we flow on our way to the sea.
