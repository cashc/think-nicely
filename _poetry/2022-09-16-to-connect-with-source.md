# I Go to Nature to Connect with the Source

I go to nature to connect with the source

I don't know what it is but I know where to find it

The mountains have it  
The marmots, eagles, and alpine lakes  
There is no hiding from your true nature here  

The simple wonders of life bombard me  
Until I am left whole  
With the joy and wonder of life
