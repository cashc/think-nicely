# Books

## Braiding Sweetgrass
##### Robin Wall Kimmerer
The book that opened up a new world to me. The description of Skywoman dancing on the turtleâ€™s back will forever guide and comfort me.

## Man's Search For Meaning
##### Viktor E. Frankl
The book that proves true and lets you experience Nietze's statement: "Given a why, a man can endure almost any how."
